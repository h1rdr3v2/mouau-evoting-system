		readTime: '8 minutes read',
		story: "The highly anticipated Students' Union Government (SUG) presidential debate at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU) took a dramatic turn yesterday evening as candidates engaged in heated exchanges over the rising insecurity on campus.\n\nThe debate, held at the university's main auditorium, saw all five presidential candidates present their manifestos before an audience of over 2,000 students. However, tensions escalated when questions about recent cult-related incidents were raised.\n\n\"We cannot continue to live in fear. Three students were attacked last week alone, and the current administration has done nothing,\" said Chioma Okafor, the only female candidate in the race, drawing loud applause from the crowd.\n\nThe incumbent SUG President's preferred candidate, Daniel Eze, defended the administration's record, citing the installation of new security lights and increased patrol. \"We have made significant progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day,\" Eze stated, prompting boos from sections of the audience.\n\nThe debate moderator, Dr. Kenneth Ugwu from the Department of Political Science, struggled to maintain order as supporters of different candidates began chanting campaign songs.\n\nOther key issues discussed included:\n• The proposed 40% increase in school fees\n• Poor internet connectivity in hostels\n• Lack of adequate lecture halls\n• Transportation challenges faced by off-campus students\n\nThe election is scheduled to hold on June 2nd, with over 15,000 students expected to participate in what many are calling the most competitive SUG election in MOUAU's history.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Mary Nwachukwu, has urged all students to maintain peace throughout the election period. \"We want a free, fair, and violence-free election. Any student found violating election guidelines will face severe consequences,\" she warned.\n\nThe Electoral Committee Chairman, Emeka Obinna, assured students that adequate measures have been put in place to ensure a transparent election process, including the deployment of electronic voting systems for the first time in the university's history."

		title: 'MOUAU Electoral Committee Disqualifies Two Presidential Candidates Over Certificate Forgery',
		date: '25th May, 2025',
		readTime: '6 minutes read',
		story: "In a shocking development that has sent ripples across Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU), the Students' Union Government Electoral Committee (SUGEC) has disqualified two presidential candidates over allegations of certificate forgery.\n\nThe disqualified candidates, whose names were given as Peter Okonkwo of the Progressive Students' Movement and Joy Ikechukwu of the Unity Alliance Party, were found to have submitted falsified academic records during the screening process.\n\nAccording to the SUGEC Chairman, Emeka Obinna, the decision was taken after a thorough investigation revealed discrepancies in the CGPA claims made by both candidates.\n\n\"After careful verification with the Exams and Records department, we discovered that Mr. Okonkwo claimed a CGPA of 3.8 when his actual CGPA is 2.7. Similarly, Miss Ikechukwu inflated her CGPA from 3.2 to 4.1,\" Obinna explained during a press briefing at the SUG secretariat.\n\nThe university's electoral law stipulates that presidential candidates must maintain a minimum CGPA of 3.0 and must not have any record of examination malpractice.\n\nThe disqualification has sparked protests from supporters of both candidates, with some alleging political manipulation. Security has been beefed up around the SUG complex following reports of planned demonstrations.\n\n\"This is a witch-hunt. My candidate's academic records are clean. We will challenge this decision at the Students' Disciplinary Committee,\" said Bright Nnadi, campaign manager for Peter Okonkwo.\n\nHowever, other students have praised the electoral committee's decision. \"This sends a strong message that electoral fraud will not be tolerated. If they can forge documents for student elections, what will they do in larger politics?\" commented Sandra Agu, a 300-level Agriculture student.\n\nThe Director of Student Affairs, Dr. Josephine Okorie, has called for calm while assuring that due process will be followed in addressing any appeals.\n\nThis development leaves only three candidates in the presidential race, with campaigns intensifying as the June 2nd election date approaches.\n\nThe remaining candidates have been urged to focus on issue-based campaigns and avoid inflammatory rhetoric that could lead to campus unrest."

		title: 'Faculty Elections: Mass Communication Department Elects First Female HOD in MOUAU History',
		date: '25th May, 2025',
		readTime: '7 minutes read',
		story: "History was made at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU) yesterday as Dr. Adaeze Nwosu became the first female Head of Department (HOD) to be elected in the Department of Mass Communication since the university's establishment.\n\nDr. Nwosu, an Associate Professor of Broadcast Journalism, defeated two other candidates in a keenly contested election that saw unprecedented turnout from academic staff members.\n\nThe election, which was conducted via secret ballot at the department's conference room, ended with Dr. Nwosu securing 18 votes out of 29 valid votes cast. Her closest rival, Dr. James Odu, garnered 8 votes, while Dr. Felix Ekwueme received 3 votes.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Dr. Nwosu promised to prioritize the accreditation of the department's postgraduate programs and the establishment of a community radio station.\n\n\"This victory is not just mine but for every woman who has been told she cannot lead. I promise to work with all members of this department to achieve our collective goals,\" she said, amid cheers from colleagues.\n\nThe Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Prof. Chukwuemeka Obi, who supervised the election, described it as \"free, fair, and a testament to the democratic values we uphold in academia.\"\n\nDr. Nwosu's election has been widely celebrated across campus, with many seeing it as a breakthrough for gender equality in the institution's leadership positions.\n\n\"For too long, women have been underrepresented in leadership positions in this university. Dr. Nwosu's election gives us hope that things are changing,\" said Dr. Patricia Eze, a lecturer in the Department of Sociology.\n\nStudent reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with the Mass Communication Students' Association (MACOSA) issuing a statement congratulating the new HOD.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Dr. Nwosu. Her track record of supporting student initiatives and her innovative teaching methods make her the perfect choice for this position,\" the statement read.\n\nHowever, the election was not without controversy. Some staff members had earlier raised concerns about the eligibility of certain candidates, leading to a two-week postponement of the original election date.\n\nDr. Nwosu, who holds a PhD from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, has been with MOUAU for 15 years and has published extensively on media and gender studies.\n\nHer tenure as HOD is expected to begin on June 1st, 2025, and will run for two years as stipulated by the university's administrative guidelines.\n\nThe successful conduct of this election comes at a time when several departments across Nigerian universities are grappling with leadership crises, making MOUAU's smooth transition noteworthy."
